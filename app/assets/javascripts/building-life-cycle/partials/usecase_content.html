        <p>
            Buildings consume 40% of all energy produced in the United States and are responsible for roughly the same proportion of US carbon emissions. Improving the energy efficiency of buildings across the country therefore represents a highly impactful approach to reaching carbon reduction goals.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Local governments have identified Strategic Energy Management (SEM) as an effective approach to reaching their carbon reduction goals. SEM comes in many forms, but can generally be defined as a systematic approach to improving the energy efficiency of buildings – leading to significant reductions in energy usage, operating costs and associated carbon emissions. Due to the systematic approach, SEM programs represent one of the most easily adoptable, cost-effective, and impactful approaches for cities to reach their energy efficiency and carbon reduction goals.

            Energy Benchmarking
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of the first technical steps of any SEM program involves the collection of building and energy-use data. The most common approach for collecting basic data is with the publically available 
            <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager">
            Energy Star Portfolio Manager.
            </a>  
            Before analytically-driven insights can be generated, however, data must be properly formatted, validated, and prepared. This represents one of the most time-consuming processes in data analysis and often requires third party guidance, resulting in high costs and slow turnaround.

        </p>  
        <p>
            In the first of three tools to help with data-driven SEM program management, Maalka released the 
            <a href="https://dataquality.maalka.com">
            Data Quality Tool 
            </a>
            to enable municipalities to validate benchmarking data against typical national values to ensure the quality of their analysis.
        </p>
        <h2 class="ui header">
            Building Energy Audits
        </h2>
        <p>
            After benchmarking the buildings in their portfolios, many municipalities take the next step to identify specific opportunities to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings. In order to identify these specific opportunities, information about more complex building characteristics and systems must be collected. This process is commonly called a Building Energy Audit.
            <img class="ui padded centered image" src="./assets/images/building-energy-audits.png" style="width:600px;">
        </p>
        <p>
            Building Energy Audits can significantly vary in depth and complexity. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers 
            <a href="https://www.ashrae.org">
            (ASHRAE) 
            </a>
            has established a standard scale that reflects the depth of audits. 
        </p>
        <div class="ui bulleted list" style="font-size:18px">
            <div class="item">ASHRAE Level I – Preliminary Walk Through Audit (Simplest)</div>
            <div class="item">ASHRAE Level II – Deeper Cost and Impact Analysis Audit</div>
            <div class="item">ASHRAE Level III – Highly Detailed Audit (Most Complex)</div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Furthermore, while most Building Energy Audits aim to identify the best improvement opportunities, data collection is not standardized across energy auditors and tools. This drives up costs and makes it difficult to leverage public and private tools designed to automate data analysis.

            A Guided Standard Approach
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Building Life Cycle Tool offers municipalities and energy service providers a transparent, cost-effective approach to collecting and structuring building energy audit data in a standardized way. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="ui small blue header">
            <i>1) WHAT KIND OF DATA DOES THE BUILDING LIFE CYCLE TOOL HELP ME COLLECT?</i>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Building Life Cycle Tool guides users in the collection of the most relevant building information that can be used to assess strategies for upgrading the building to run more efficiently. Users are guided by a dynamic survey for collecting data on the most important building Systems (e.g. HVAC, Ventilation, Lighting Systems) and relevant Measures (e.g. Boiler Improvements, Lighting Upgrades). In this way, users can follow a standardized approach for collecting initial Building Audit data, as each system and measure is defined by a set of associated, standardized fields. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As the tool is open-source, new systems, measures, and features can be easily added to extend functionality for specific program needs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="ui small blue header">
            <i>2) HOW DO I USE THE BUILDING ASSET TOOL TO COLLECT DATA?</i>
        </h2>
        <img class="ui padded centered image" src="./assets/images/systems-tab.png" style="width:700px;">
        <p>
            Systems”: The section to the right of the survey input, labeled “Required Fields” provides a list of the most common building systems that impact the energy efficiency of a building. When a user clicks on a System in the list, the survey to the left dynamically adjusts to reflect the associated fields to be populated for the System. If the field value is unknown by the user, they can skip over it to the next field
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon completing the questions for a System, the user can click the ‘Add to List’ button to save the system. This will be reflected in the list when the icon for the System changes from a red ‘X’ to a blue checkmark. This allows users to track the systems for which they have the required data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can add data for additional systems not in the list by selecting a System type from the top Dropdown menu in the survey. The survey will similarly update to reflect the data related the System, which can be added to the saved list of systems.
        </p>  
        <img class="ui padded centered image" src="./assets/images/measures-tab.png" style="width:700px;">
        <p>
            “Measures”: Measures are specific actions that can be taken to improve the energy efficiency of a building. To enable SEM, it is essential to track which measures have been implemented and which are planned to be implemented. The Building Life Cycle Tool allows users to enter and track measures in a standardized way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to adding a System, users can toggle to the tab labeled ‘Measures’ at the top of the survey section and select one of twelve Measures from the top dropdown. Each measure will have generic details associated with implementation status as well as Measure specific fields that can be populated.
        </p>
        <p>
            After filling in details for a measure, a user can click ‘Add to List’ to save the measure. Users can add as many measures as necessary, which will be graphed on the visual timeline based on start date.
        </p>
        <img class="ui padded centered image" src="./assets/images/timeline.png" style="width:800px;">
        <p>
            The visual timeline can be printed and integrated in building reports.
        </p>
        <h2 class="ui small blue header">
            <i>3) CAN I EXPORT THE RESULTS OF THE DATA QUALITY TOOL?</i>
        </h2>
        <p>
            In addition to guiding users in the collection of data for the most common building systems and measures, the Building Life Cycle Tool allows users to export the data in a standardized format so that it can be analyzed and used by third parties to jump start Building Energy Audits.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool leverages the 
            <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/building-energy-data-exchange-specification-bedes">Building Energy Data Exchange Specification (BEDES) 
            </a>
            and the 
            <a href="https://buildingsync.net/about/">
            BuildingSync®
            </a>
            schema to standardize data for use across a range of applications. BuildingSync® is a standardized language for commercial building energy audit data that software developers can use to exchange data between audit tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            Structured, standardized data can be exported from the tool in two ways:
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common method to export data is by clicking the ‘Download CSV’ button. 
        <img class="ui padded centered image" src="./assets/images/download.png" style="width:500px;">
        </p>
        <p>
            This will provide users a CSV file with a list of all Systems and Measures in a standardized format. Municipalities can generate CSV files for each building in their portfolio and then combine them to view a distribution of system types and measures across their portfolio. This data can also be integrated with energy-use data and passed to third parties who can jumpstart a Building Energy Audit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second method to export data is by clicking the ‘Print JSON’ button.
        <img class="ui padded centered image" src="./assets/images/view-json.png" style="width:500px;">
        </p>
        <p>
            Primarily intended for software developers, this button will print the Systems and Measures data in a machine-readable BuildingSync-compatible format. The intention of this feature is to enable third parties to leverage the Building Life Cycle Tool for automating data collection and integrating with powerful BuildingSync compatible data analysis tools. One powerful public platform is OpenStudio®, which is a collection of software tools for whole building energy modeling using EnergyPlus and advanced daylight analysis using Radiance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Building Life Cycle Tool will ensure that collected data is compatible with OpenStudio®, which will enable valuable downstream applications such as remote building audits.
        </p>
        <h2 class="ui header">
            HOW DOES THE DATA QUALITY TOOL WORK ON THE MAALKA PLATFORM?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Data Quality Tool is fully open-source and can be downloaded 
            <a href="https://github.com/Maalka/building_life_cycle">
            here.
            </a>
            With additional technical knowledge, users can extend the Systems and Measures supported in Data Collection and integrate the tool into other data collection and reporting processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool also sits within the Maalka platform as part of an integrated workflow that allows municipalities to track the collection of Systems and Measures across an entire Portfolio. The data can be dynamically combined with energy-use data collected during the Benchmarking Process and then automatically passed to OpenStudio to create a fully calibrated EnergyPlus model. These models can be used to assess the potential of measures to improve Energy Efficiency across a whole portfolio.
